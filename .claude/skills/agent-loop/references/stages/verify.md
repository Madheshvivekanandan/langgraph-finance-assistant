# Stage: verify

**Reads:** `plan.md` (or `task.md` for tier S), `profile.md`, and the working-tree diff — obtained
yourself via `git diff` / `git status`. **Nothing else.**
**Writes:** `test-report.md` (template: `templates/test-report.md`) — and nothing else, ever.
Being spawned without file-write tools does not block this: write the report through the shell
(output redirection to the given path). On hosts with per-tool restriction that is the normal
path, not the exception — such hosts restrict by tool, not by file, so there is no way to grant a
write tool for this one artifact. Only if the host blocks even shell writes, return the full
report as your reply instead: the orchestrator persists it verbatim to the artifact path.
**Restrictions:** no code edits, by any means. Ideally you were spawned without file-write tools;
where the host cannot enforce that, the orchestrator fingerprints the diff before and after this
stage and voids your verdict if the working tree moved. Writing your report file is the only
mutation you may perform.
**Budget:** at most 15 tool calls.
**Reasoning demand:** high. Spotting the gap between what a plan required and what a diff actually
does is harder than writing the diff was, and this stage is the loop's only termination condition.

You deliberately do **not** receive the implementer's reasoning, summary, or `implementation.md`.
Judge the work fresh from the requirements and the diff.

## Job

1. Read the plan's requirements and its **Runnable check**.
2. Read the diff.
3. Run the runnable check and the project's standard test/lint commands from `profile.md`. Capture
   real output. A verdict without executed commands is not a verdict.
4. Check the diff against the project's own standards — the conventions and any standards files
   recorded in `profile.md`. A stated project rule is a requirement, not a style preference.
5. Judge: does the diff satisfy the stated requirements and the project's standards, and do the
   checks pass?

## What counts as a finding

Report **only gaps that affect correctness or the stated requirements**. Style preferences,
hypothetical edge cases outside the task's scope, and "could be nicer" observations are not
findings — a verifier that manufactures gaps is as harmful as one that rubber-stamps, because it
sends the debug loop after phantoms and burns the iteration cap.

One exception cuts the other way: a check that cannot fail — a tautological assertion, a command
that exits 0 regardless of the code — is always a finding, because it corrupts the loop's
termination condition. Never wave one through as non-blocking.

If you find nothing wrong and the checks pass, the correct answer is PASS with empty findings. Say
so plainly.

## Output

1. **Verdict** — exactly `PASS` or `FAIL`. Never free-text approval.
2. **Findings** — for FAIL: each finding with file, what is wrong, and why it violates the plan or
   breaks correctness. Empty for PASS.
3. **Not verified** — every acceptance criterion you could not execute (the plan marks it manual,
   or running it would mutate a live environment). A PASS certifies only what was actually run;
   write "None" when everything was.
4. **Evidence** — the commands you ran and their actual output, trimmed to the relevant tail.
   Required for PASS and FAIL alike.

## Return

At most 10 lines: the verdict, finding count, anything under **Not verified**, and the path to
`test-report.md`.
